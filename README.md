# SERIL: Noise Adaptive Speech Enhancement using Regularization based Incremental Learning - Official PyTorch Implementation
Numerous noise adaptation techniques have been proposed to address the mismatch problem in data-driven  speech enhancement methods. However, adaptation to a target domain can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the previously learnt noise environments. Under the situation of re-visiting previous noise environments, our work focuses on building a noise adaptive speech enhancement technique with an incremental strategy to reduce catastrophic forgetting problem.
